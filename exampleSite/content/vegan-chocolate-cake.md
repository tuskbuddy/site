Don't let the "vegan" bit turn you away. Oreos are vegan, and we all know how delicious the Double Stufs are. And this cake is legitimately good. It's gluten-free, dairy-free, and egg-free, _and_ all of the ingredients are common grocery store items! Incredible! Many gluten-free dessert recipes use obscure ingredients to produce a decadent cake, but this one does very well with what's readily available.

There is one caveat: I wouldn't recommend using this recipe for tiered cakes. The cake doesn't stick together as much as it would with eggs, which can make frosting even a single pan a delicate operation. However, it's excellent for a company party or informal get-together where you need a dessert that just works, every time.

#### Where's this recipe from?

This cake recipe was crafted by [The Pretty Bee](https://theprettybee.com/easiest-gluten-free-vegan-chocolate-cake/ "The Pretty Bee"), a recipe website for those of us with food allergies and sensitivities.

#### Anything to know before making it?

This cake is a little more difficult to frost than normal cakes, but it's more than doable for a single pan. If you're concerned about presentation, I recommend dusting the top with powdered sugar instead.

My family made a version of this recipe that substituted a 1/2 cup of water with a 1/2 cup of coffee, and I highly recommend making the sub if it's not much trouble. There wasn't much difference between this and the original, but the change added just enough flavor to create a delightful mix of cocoa and coffee.
