[This recipe's from Emily Bites!](https://emilybites.com/2018/07/spanish-chicken-and-rice-skillet.html "Spanish Chicken & Rice") She has plenty of homestyle-ish recipes that have been battle-tested in Wengerd households across the nation.

This particular recipe is a ~~family favorite~~ bachelor favorite. Tomato and paprika is a foolproof combination, and the olive oil and garlic bring it together nicely.

I'm not normally big on olives, but I really enjoy what they bring in this dish. If you can eat olives on pizza, you may want to consider throwing a few into the pot at the end. If you don't like them, there's no shame in that. A half cup of diced green peppers also gives the dish some greenery and texture if you're not a fan. If you like them so much you can eat a full jar in one sitting, then I'm confident your stomach of steel will handle this recipe just fine.
