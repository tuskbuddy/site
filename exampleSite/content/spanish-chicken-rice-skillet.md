This particular recipe is a ~~family favorite~~ bachelor favorite. Tomato and paprika is a foolproof combination, and the olive oil, garlic, and freshly ground black pepper bring it together nicely. This one-pot recipe offers an excellent meal with a small amount of preparation and minimal clean-up.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[Emily Bites!](https://emilybites.com/2018/07/spanish-chicken-and-rice-skillet.html "Spanish Chicken & Rice") That's the name of the website, not an express disdain for my real estate agent. She has plenty of homestyle-ish recipes that have been battle-tested in Wengerd households across the nation. For those looking to eat well, she also provides Weight Watchers points for each recipe.

#### Anything to know before making it?

I'm not normally keen on green olives, but I really enjoy what they bring in this dish. If you can eat olives on pizza, you may want to consider throwing a few into the pot at the end. If you don't like them, there's no shame in that: a half cup of diced green peppers offers similar greenery and texture if you're not a fan. If you like them so much you can eat a full jar in one sitting, then you're a marvel of science, and I'm confident your stomach of steel will handle this recipe quite well.
