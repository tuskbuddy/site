American-Chinese food is a great go-to takeout option, and well-made orange chicken is a delicacy. This recipe uses fresh orange and ginger to deliver an exotic tangy sauce that gets high ratings from me.

Quick note: this is likely the most time-consuming recipe on this website, but I wouldn't give it the honor of your attention without believing that it's worth the work. It'll take longer, but taste fresher, than takeout.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[Dinner then Dessert](https://dinnerthendessert.com/panda-express-orange-chicken-copycat/ "DtD"), a blog by a trained professional chef with a mix of easy and time-consuming recipes. She also has Instant Pot recipes and restaurant copycat recipes.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Keep the oil at 325 degrees. You will need much more flour & cornstarch than it calls for (twice as much?). You may add up to 1/4 c each of oat milk and soy sauce to the egg mixture; feel free to liberally add choice spices to the flour mixture as well.
