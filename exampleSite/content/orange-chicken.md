#### Where's this recipe from?

#### Anything to know before making it?

This is likely the most time-consuming recipe on this website, but I wouldn't give it the honor of your attention without believing that it's worth every minute of hard work. The tangy, gingery sauce gets high ratings from me.

Keep the oil at 325 F. Note that you'll need much more flour & cornstarch than it calls for. You may add up to 1/4 c each of oat milk + soy sauce to the egg mixture; feel free to liberally add choice spices to the flour mixture as well.
