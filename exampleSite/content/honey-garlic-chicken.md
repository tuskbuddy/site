It's a simple dish, but the olive oil, sweet potatoes, and oregano really work here. The tiny bit of mustard and honey provide a sweet tangy flavor as well. Surprisingly few ingredients in this one, but it stands above many other recipes with far more ingredients and prep time.

#### Where's this recipe from?

This one comes straight from [RealSimpleGood](https://realsimplegood.com/one-pan-honey-garlic-chicken/ "RSG"). They have 18 pages of recipes for gluten-free, dairy-free, paleo, keto, and Whole30 eaters. I don't know what a paleo diet is, but this recipe fits within the constraints of it, and probably a few others as well.

#### Anything to know before making it?

The one-pot nature of this dish allows for relatively short prep time, but most of that will be spent chopping sweet potatoes, which can be difficult to cut without a strong knife. Since chicken tends to dry out easily in the oven, you may also want to sear your chicken in a skillet with some olive oil for a few minutes before putting it in the pan.

Dijon mustard is just as good as yellow mustard in terms of ingredient subs. There's also some oiliness to the dish, and you can change the amount of oil you add according to taste. Personally, I like adding the full amount for the sake of the sweet potatoes and broccoli, then draining it at the end.
