Mmm, breadsticks. Spelt flour is great for the gluten-sensitive, but it also adds a nutty flavor lacking in all-purpose flour. This dish is best made with white spelt flour, but wheat flour makes good breadsticks when warm and paired with heaps of marinara sauce.

#### Where's the recipe from?

[The Pretty Bee!](https://theprettybee.com/vegan-garlic-herb-breadsticks-marinara-sauce/ "The Pretty Bee") A one-stop shop for allergy-friendly recipes made by a mother with allergy-sensitive children.

#### Anything to know before making it?

The recipe calls for 3 cups of spelt flour, but you'll likely need 4 or more, which will make 12-18 breadsticks. Make small breadsticks to start and spread the baking sheet with olive oil before letting rise.
