Chef John's tikka masala is perhaps the best recipe I've made this year. One key step in this recipe is stirring the onions and tomato paste on medium-high heat: the long caramelization process blends incredibly well with the aromatic spice mix, coconut milk, and accumulated chicken juices.

#### Where's this recipe from?

Chef John! If you're not familiar with him, you should take a look at his YouTube channel [Food Wishes](https://www.youtube.com/user/foodwishes "Food Wishes"). Each video outlines a recipe with a story behind it and an explanation behind each step. The tikka masala video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NshiJSNBWNs "Tikka Masala Video"), and the full recipe with steps and ingredients can be found [here](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239867/chef-johns-chicken-tikka-masala/ "Tikka Masala Recipe").

#### Anything to know before making it?

Caramelize the onions at least five minutes longer. Ideally, the onions will be a little blackened by the time you put in the tomato paste. And don't worry if you get black onion at the bottom of the pan. You don't want to burn the fond, sure, but the extra long caramelization really makes a difference.

Chef John cut the chicken into mid-sized chunks, but I cut mine into thin strips to produce a higher sauce-to-chicken ratio per bite. I didn't use ghee or ground cardamom my first time since I didn't have any on hand (and both can be more expensive than they're worth), but the meal was mighty excellent without them.
