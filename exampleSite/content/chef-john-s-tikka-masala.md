#### Where's this recipe from?

Chef John! If you're not familiar with him, you should take a look at his YouTube channel [Food Wishes](https://www.youtube.com/user/foodwishes "Food Wishes"). Each video outlines a recipe with a story behind it and an explanation behind each step. The tikka masala video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NshiJSNBWNs "Tikka Masala Video"), and the full recipe with steps and ingredients can be found [here](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239867/chef-johns-chicken-tikka-masala/ "Tikka Masala Recipe").

#### What's to like about this recipe?

This is perhaps the best meal I've made this year. It's much better than takeout. One key step in this recipe is stirring the onions and tomato paste on medium-high heat: the long caramelization process blends incredibly well with the aromatic spice mix, coconut milk, and accumulated chicken juices.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Chef John cut the chicken into mid-sized chunks, but I cut mine into thin strips and really enjoyed it that way. I didn't use ghee or ground cardamom my first time since I didn't have any on hand (and both can be more expensive than they're worth), but the meal was mighty excellent without them.
