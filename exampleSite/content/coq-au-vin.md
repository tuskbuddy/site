A French chicken stew with chicken, mushrooms, and vegetables braised in a red wine sauce. Mashed potatoes are a popular complimentary side dish, and sweet potatoes with cinnamon and sugar are also popular in this household.

Where can I find this recipe?

Chef John [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239230/chef-johns-coq-au-vin/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239230/chef-johns-coq-au-vin/ "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239230/chef-johns-coq-au-vin/") and "Darn" Delicious [https://damndelicious.net/2022/01/08/easy-coq-au-vin/](https://damndelicious.net/2022/01/08/easy-coq-au-vin/ "https://damndelicious.net/2022/01/08/easy-coq-au-vin/") both have great recipes with marginal differences. The former recipe forms a fond or roue while the latter produces more of a stew.

How do I pronounce this?

Google Translate and Chef John say "coke uh vawn". Don't forget the French accent!

What else should I know?

The bacon and about the half the mushrooms for each recipe aren't strictly necessary, but never frowned upon. Using red wine vinegar in place of the wine also works. Adding greens to the stew recipe also helps reduce the liquid.
