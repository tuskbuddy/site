A French chicken stew with chicken, mushrooms, and vegetables braised in a red wine sauce. Mashed potatoes are a popular complimentary side dish -- I personally recommend sweet potatoes with cinnamon and sugar.

#### Where can I find this recipe?

[Chef John](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239230/chef-johns-coq-au-vin/) and ["Darn" Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2022/01/08/easy-coq-au-vin/) both have great recipes with marginal differences. The former recipe forms a roue while the latter produces more of a stew.

#### How do I pronounce this?

Chef John says "coke uh vawn". Don't forget the French accent!

#### What else should I know?

The bacon and about the half the mushrooms for each recipe aren't strictly necessary, but never frowned upon. Using red wine vinegar in place of the wine also works for a non-alcoholic version but the resulting broth will become more pungent. Adding greens to the stew recipe helps reduce the liquid.
