Meatloaf with mashed potatoes is my all-time favorite comfort food. The beef and pork mixture with a sauce that perfectly balances sweet and tangy makes this recipe a standout for home-style cooks.

#### Where's this recipe from?

This recipe comes in part from [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/moist-savory-meat-loaf/ "Taste of Home") with some add-ins from a family recipe. The changes are just drastic enough that I'm going to post the full recipe here, instead of listing all of the modifications and leaving you to anxiously compare two sources, even though the inspiration from Taste of Home is pretty clear here.

#### Great! What's the recipe?

**Ingredients**

1 medium onion, chopped

2 tsp canola oil

2 large eggs, lightly beaten

1/3 cup 2% milk

2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce

2 tsp Dijon mustard

2/3 cup quick oats or finely crushed cheese crackers

1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp pepper

1/4 tsp thyme

1 lb ground beef

1 lb ground pork

**Sauce**

2/3 cup ketchup

A little mustard

4 tbsp brown sugar

A bit of vinegar

**Directions**

Saute onion in oil in a small skillet until tender. Cool to room temperature. 

Combine the eggs, milk, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, oats, salt, pepper, thyme and onion in a large bowl. Crumble beef and pork over mixture and mix well. Shape into a loaf; place in a greased 11x7 baking dish.

Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for an hour. Combine sauce ingredients and spread sauce over meatloaf. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until no pink remains and a thermometer reads 160 degrees. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
