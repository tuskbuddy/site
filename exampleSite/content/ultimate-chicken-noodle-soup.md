Chicken, noodles, carrots, and celery in a bowl with bread and crackers on the side is hard to beat. The hearty flavor comes straight from the thyme and bay leaves infused into the broth. Overall, a classic to warm you up on a cool day.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/the-ultimate-chicken-noodle-soup/ "Taste of Home"), the American home-style cooking magazine I'm frankly surprised is still around. Perhaps their most excellent feature is that the ingredients and directions are near the top of the page for your convenience! The important bits are, refreshingly, not padded with five hundred paragraphs of SEO filler like many, many other recipe blogs.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Excellent as is. I like to sub in rice noodles or cooked rice in for the egg noodles. If you're cooking for one, cut the recipe in half.
