A Mediterrane-ish marinade with golden-brown chicken and oven-baked rice. The lemon-garlic marinade comes with a touch of djion mustard, thyme, and oregano, along with some extra garlic and onion for the rice mixture. The parsley and lemon slices also make for easy dish decor.

#### Where's the recipe from?

This one's brought to you by ~~Squarespace~~ [Downshiftology]( https://downshiftology.com/recipes/one-pan-chicken-and-rice/ "Downshiftology"), a place for recipe-travel-lifestyle, uh, lifestyles. The blog gives off an influencer vibe, as the author travels the world making both videos and money off of health coaching and sponsorships. It's far from the type of material I'd dream of reading, but tasteful recipes extend beyond taste in blog content.

I should also note: there are multiple titles for this recipe on the blog and they're either ambiguous or hyperbolic (e.g., "Best Chicken and Rice"). The title given here, while supremely unhelpful for web searching the recipe later, is much more descriptive, and allows the multitude of [other](https://www.cooks.com/recipe/gw9xm0io/the-best-chicken-and-rice.html "ABSOLUTELY THE BEST RECIPE") [claims](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/the-best-chicken-and-rice-8133711 "THIS IS THE BEST IN EVERY WAY") [for](https://www.seasonedhomemaker.com/best-chicken-rice-recipe/ "NO WAIT THIS ONE IS BEST OF ALL") [the](https://thecookinchicks.com/best-ever-chicken-and-rice-casserole/ "OK ACTUALLY THIS ONE IS BEST BEST") [best](https://www.vivarecipes.com/videos/chicken/the-best-oven-baked-chicken-and-rice-ever-baked-chicken-recipe/ "DEFINITIVELY BEST, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT") to duke it out in their own arena.

#### What should I know before making this?

Boneless chicken thighs work great, but a recipe that cooks the whole chicken pieces and sears the skin works best with bone-in thighs. Either way the thighs should come out fork-tender, and you can shred the chicken if you like uniform meat distribution, don't care for bones, or plan on having leftovers.

Use as little excess marinade as possible in the pan while searing the chicken. The olive oil does its job best without excess juice in the pan.
