Low-effort, healthy dishes are valuable in this household, and this three-ingredient marinade compliments the chicken, zucchini, and tomatoes remarkably. I'm ordinarily not a huge fan of tomatoes, but the ones in this recipe are delicious when roasted and drizzled with the marinade. Olive oil, dijon mustard, and balsamic vinegar mixed together is so easy and foolproof I'm a little amazed I hadn't thought of it earlier.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a22607407/balsamic-basil-chicken-recipe/ "Delishhhhh"), which I've mentioned is like BuzzFeed for recipes. They're still at it with can't-miss headlines such as "24 Awesome Pool Floats Every Food Lover Should Own" and "This Pic Of Reese Witherspoon And Ava Phillippe Looking Identical In Holiday Sweaters Got 1.7M Likes".

#### Anything to know before making it?

I used unchopped grape tomatoes in one iteration, which are great for lowering the effort on this already low-effort dish, but I enjoyed the chopped cherry tomatoes a smidge more since they seemed to roast better and absorb more flavor.
