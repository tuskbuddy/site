This is the only chocolate chip cookie I've made for the past five years. It's a little crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside, which is a brutally delicious combination for an excellent cookie. This one is a hit everywhere I take it, and it will take much convincing for me to try another recipe.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[The Baking Chocolatess](https://www.thebakingchocolatess.com/perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies/ "The Baking Chocolatess")! There are more dessert recipes on this website than I'm willing to make in my lifetime. The author loves chocolate, and her burning passion for the stuff is evident with the types of desserts she makes.

#### Anything to know before making it?

All-purpose flour and butter can be substituted for gluten-free flour and coconut oil, respectively, if you want to make a gluten-free and dairy-free version. A fair warning if you do this -- I made the alternate version for a group of friends and there were multiple reports of varying digestive aftermath. Most of it was short-lived, and the worst case of it was reported after the individual ate at least six cookies in one quick sitting. I do not recommend this level of consumption for the gluten-full or gluten-free version.

There are two important things to know about making this recipe:

1. **Use 1.5 cups of chocolate chips!** This lady has some mad chocolate chip fever because she beckons you to use 50% more chocolate chips. Don't do it! It's not worth the sweet, sweet pain! You'll be drowning in chocolate chip sorrow before you realize your terrible mistake.
2. Apart from the chocolate chip malarky, do follow the instructions to a tee. Don't mix the dough any more than absolutely necessary, and set the butter out a little early (or microwave for 8-10 seconds) to get it to room temperature. The cookies should seem very nearly done when you take them out of the oven and then firm up nicely after cooling.

I've made white sugar-only variations of this cookie that turned out well. I also like to sprinkle some cinnamon, nutmeg, or allspice on top of each cookie before baking.
