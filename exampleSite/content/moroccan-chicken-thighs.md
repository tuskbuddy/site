Mediterranean food is a weakness of mine. The aromatic spices stir up nostalgia for the restaurant close to where I went to school, the restaurant with an all-you-can-eat buffet of rice pilaf, tzatziki sauce, and delicious shwarma. This recipe is not rice pilaf, tzatziki sauce, or shwarma, but it's delicious and scratches the ol' Mediterranean itch.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[A Cedar Spoon](https://www.acedarspoon.com/moroccan-chicken-thighs/ "A Cedar Spoon"), a nearly decade-old recipe blog with Mediterranean flavor and influence. The author also has a plethora of crock-pot and Instant Pot recipes.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Use a small fresh diced tomato instead of the 15 oz can: fewer tomatoes will help the spices stand out, and fresh tomatoes are better anyway. Mission figs can be difficult to find, and green olives are a mixed bag in terms of taste, so you can sub in some zucchini and/or summer squash in place of either.
