Hands-down, this is the best pad Thai recipe I've ever made. It _is_ the only pad Thai recipe I've ever made, but it's far too good to let any other recipe even attempt to claim superiority to this restaurant-grade meal.

I have, as you'll see below, made a few changes to the original recipe,  As someone who has read many reviews of people praising the recipe while changing practically everything except the main ingredient, I've made the recipe both ways. It's a delightful recipe as-is: the changes below add more sauce to the dish, use more common ingredients, and give it a slightly tangier flavor.

#### Where's this recipe from?

This delectable recipe comes from a site called [Tastes Better from Scratch](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/pad-thai/ "Tastes Better from Scratch"). This particular recipe has a 4.93 / 5 rating from over 800 votes, which should give you an idea of how well-received it is.

#### Anything to know before making it?

I used 8 oz brown rice noodles; 1 lb chicken; 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce for every 3 tbsp fish sauce; used sunflower butter for peanut butter; added 0.5 tbsp for every 2 tbsp rice vinegar; and doubled the sauce.

The thicker the peanut/sunflower butter, the better. The sunflower butter substitute is there only because I have a peanut allergy: don't go out of your way to buy the stuff unless you too have the Reese's curse.
