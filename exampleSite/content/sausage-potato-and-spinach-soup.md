The browned sausage, peppery broth, and red pepper flakes give a spicy but homey quality to this soup. It's a little creamy with a diverse blend of vegetables and soft potatoes, perfect for a weeknight at home under a couple of blankets, watching the hottest new episode of _Nifty Show About Which People Are Currently Talking About_.

#### Where's this recipe from?

This recipe is from [Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2014/10/29/sausage-potato-spinach-soup/ "DD"), and is a bit of an oldie (2014) compared to the other recipes on the blog. Recipes for soup seem to retain a timeless quality that many other recipes don't -- one [soup recipe](tuskbuddy.tk/chicken-tortilla-soup "Chicken Tortilla Soup") on the blog is from 2009.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Use 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. I've used kielbasa instead of Italian sausage for this recipe every time I've made it, and it works so well in this dish that I'd need some heavy-handed persuasion to choose another type of sausage here. Feel free to sub in oat milk or whole milk in place of heavy cream as well.
