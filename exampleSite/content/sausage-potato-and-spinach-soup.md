#### Where's this recipe from?

This recipe is from [Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2014/10/29/sausage-potato-spinach-soup/ "DD"), and is a bit of an oldie (2014) compared to the other recipes on the blog. 

#### Anything to know before making it?

Use 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. I've used kielbasa instead of Italian sausage for this recipe every time I've made it, and it works so well in this dish that I'd need some heavy-handed persuasion to choose another type of sausage here. Feel free to sub in oat milk or whole milk in place of heavy cream as well.
