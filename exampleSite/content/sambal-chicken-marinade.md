This is an excellent Southeast Asian-style grilled chicken marinade with just a few simple but potent ingredients. I've used it as a skillet marinade before, and it was quite good, but I will say it lacked the depth, char, and aroma that only a strong, smoky grill could bring. Recommended as a grill recipe, but still wonderful from the stove top.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[Fillmore Kitchen](https://www.fillmorekitchen.com/sambal-chicken-thighs/ "Fillmore Kitchen"), a site with an emphasis on excellent and achievable recipes that are "easy enough for a weeknight, good enough for a dinner party." It looks like a small operation, considering there are only a few hundred followers on the Pinstagrams, so check them out if this recipe ends up being a keeper.

#### Anything to know before making it?

This is good as is! It's a great recipe for a quick weeknight or a lazy grilling day. If you can't find sambal oelek at the store, you can sub in sriracha for similar results.
