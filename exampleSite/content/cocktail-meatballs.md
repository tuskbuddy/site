If you're in the mood for meatballs but want an alternative to marinara or Swedish-style sauces, this is for you. This sauce is made from all kinds of other sauces: cranberry sauce, barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and sweet chili sauce all come together under low heat to bring a sweet, tangy, and spicy offering.

#### Where's this recipe from?

These glorious meatballs come from [Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23694828/cocktail-meatballs/ "Delish"), which is a BuzzFeed-esque recipe site with quality top-of-the-hour headlines such as "There's A SpongeBob Hot Cocoa Bomb Filled With A Pineapple-Shaped Vanilla Marshmallow" and "Johna \[sic\] Cena Ate 31 Empanadas And Almost Threw Up While Filming A New Movie".

#### Anything to know before making it?

Unless you want to use some of the meatball sauce for dipping, serving, swimming, or bathing, you may either use 2 lb of ground beef or reduce the sauce measurements to 75% with 1.5 lb beef. I often do the latter, given that many cranberry sauce cans only carry 1.5 cups each.

Red pepper flakes are optional, since the sweet chili sauce will likely be spicy enough. Do note that the spiciness of sweet chili sauce varies by brand: you should be getting a mild or medium level sauce. Maggi, Meijer, and Kroger brands are good; the Walmart Great Value brand is too spicy. Sweet chili sauce can be found in aisles with ethnic food or dipping sauce for wings.
