#### Where's this recipe from?

[RealSimpleGood](https://realsimplegood.com/thai-basil-chicken-bowls/ "Real. Comfortable. Jeans."), which is a recipe-lifestyle site for those on paleo, Whole30, or keto diets. Recipes from those diets tend to cater better to what I can eat than traditional recipes, so I've used their ideas as inspiration for some of my own.

#### What's to like about this recipe?

It's a stir-fry classic. It sounds, smells, and tastes like good stir-fry, and is more robust than something you'd find at most Chinese restaurants or make from bottles with pre-made sauce. I haven't been able to make it with fresh Thai basil yet, but it's plenty delicious with Italian basil or dried basil.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Don't go to the supermarket and take over a minute to open a plastic bag then see a couple who was waiting on you and grab two jalapeños when you finally pry the insolent bag open because you didn't want to be that guy who took forever to open the bag just to get one jalapeño. And don't think "Ah why don't I just use both jalapeños in this recipe" because more than one jalapeño is _definitely_ too spicy. If you're not big on spice, half a jalapeño is a much better bet, especially if you're the neanderthal who thought it'd be a bright idea to snag two jalapeños.

The original cooks do use some peculiar ingredients cause they follow a paleo diet, but you can make the following substitutions: olive oil for avocado oil, soy sauce for coconut aminos, Worcestershire sauce for fish sauce, white rice for cauliflower rice, and cornstarch for arrowroot powder. And please, go easy on the jalapeño.
