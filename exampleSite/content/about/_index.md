I'm an aerospace engineer from Ohio who currently lives in Houston, Texas. I enjoy eating Indian food, drinking cold brew coffee, and playing Breath of the Wild.

I use gluten and dairy free ingredients (or make reasonable substitutes) due to a particular [digestive condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic_esophagitis "Wikipedia"), and I cook for one most of the time, so it's not always easy to find recipes that fit my lifestyle. I also really like chicken. The recipes I've gathered here are a reflection of my endeavors to find delicious meals which satisfy my constraints.
