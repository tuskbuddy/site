I'm an aerospace engineer from Ohio who currently lives in Houston, Texas. I enjoy eating Indian food, drinking cold brew coffee, and playing board games. I use gluten and dairy free ingredients (or make reasonable substitutes) due to a particular [digestive condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic_esophagitis "Wikipedia"), and I cook for one most of the time, so it's not always easy to find recipes that fit my lifestyle. The recipes on this website are the ones that do.

### Recipes

Every recipe here is for the gluten-free and dairy-free eaters out there, and I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I do. Each one has been through kitchen testing to become 100% Wengerd-approved.

My analysis and personal tweaks for each recipe can be found in the posts. Each post also contains a link to the recipe's original page, where you can view the ingredients and shower the wonderful authors with your finest compliments.
