I'm an aerospace engineer by trade looking to make simple, delicious, and allergy-friendly recipes accessible to everyone. All recipes here contain ingredients free from gluten, dairy, and nuts (or make reasonable substitutes) to work around these food intolerances, and I cook for one most of the time, so it's not always easy to find recipes that fit this lifestyle and don't call for obscure ingredients like psyllium husk.

### Recipes

Each recipe here has been through kitchen testing to become 100% taste bud-approved and I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I do. My analysis and personal tweaks for each recipe can be found in the posts. Each post also contains a link to the recipe's original page, where you can view the ingredients and shower the wonderful authors with your finest compliments.
