I'm an aerospace engineer from Ohio who currently lives in Houston, Texas. I enjoy eating Indian food, drinking cold brew coffee, and playing Breath of the Wild.

I use gluten and dairy free ingredients (or make reasonable substitutes) due to a particular [digestive condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic_esophagitis "Wikipedia"), and I cook for one most of the time, so it's not always easy to find recipes that fit my lifestyle. I also really like chicken. The recipes I've gathered here are a reflection of my endeavors to find delicious meals which satisfy my constraints.

### Recipes

This website is a collection of recipes I've gathered from a number of incredible chefs, and each one has been through exhaustive testing to become Wengerd-approved. The finer details of what I thought about each recipe and any changes I made can be found in each post.

Making a website and organizing my recipes was on my to-do list not too long ago, and I figured I'd combine the two tasks and make a website to organize my recipes. Do note that though I say "my" recipes, these recipes do come from talented cooks who aren't me, and who deserve remarkable recognition. Each post contains a link to the recipe's original page, where you can view the ingredients and shower the authors with your finest compliments.
