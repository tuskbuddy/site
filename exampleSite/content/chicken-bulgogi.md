Also known as dak bulgogi, this spicy, tender dish is surprisingly simple. Just marinade thin strips of meat overnight in a bag of gochujang with other sweet & savory ingredients, cook it up on medium-high heat or over the grill, and serve over rice.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2019/04/21/korean-beef-bulgogi/ "DD"), which employs two food stylists, a videographer, operations manager, and two wonderful [mascots](https://damndelicious.net/author/buttersrhee/ "doggs"). Do note that I've adapted this recipe from beef to chicken. This particular recipe also has a little less filler text before the directions than what most recipes have, so it deserves some bonus points for brevity.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Sub chicken thighs for flank steak, of course. The linked recipe uses steak over a grill pan, which I'm sure is delicious -- I used the chicken in a skillet over stove top and it was great. Chicken breasts are far more prone to drying out than thighs, so I recommend using only beef or chicken thighs for this recipe.

I didn't freeze the meat for 30 minutes, but you may want to do so if you're using steak.

The pear may seem inconsequential, but between this recipe and another almost identical recipe sans pear, this one is better. Pears are a tragically underrated fruit, and I'm sure a pear tree in California would be awfully grateful if you used the literal fruit of their labor for a worthy cause. I used a Bartlett pear and it was a tad sweeter and juicier than without.

I also put the vegetable oil and >2 green onions into the marinade the first time, whoops, but it turned out to be delicious anyway.
