#### Where's this recipe from?

This recipe is brought to you by [The Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/classic-chicken-fried-rice/ "Woks of Life"), an Asian family with Asian-inspired recipes. This is the only recipe from them that I've made, but the [chicken mei fun](https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-mei-fun/ "Chicken Mei Fun") is on my short list. They also have blog posts about Chinese ingredients, cooking methods, and travel experiences.

#### What's to like about this recipe?

Everything. I love fried rice. The sesame oil, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce give the meal the wok-fresh taste that elevates this recipe over a few others I've tried.

#### Anything to know before making it?

The recipe uses light and dark soy sauce. If you don't have one or the other, you can use regular soy sauce without making a major difference. You can also replace the Shaoxing wine with rice vinegar.

Do add a bit more soy sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1-2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce at the very end. Guaranteed restaurant-quality fri-ri. Feel free to add green peppers, shredded carrots, or peas at the end as well.

Fried rice is known to be oily, and this recipe is no exception, so take note and adjust accordingly.
