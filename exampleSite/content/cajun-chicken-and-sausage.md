This recipe is exactly what it sounds and looks like: pasta, chicken, sausage, and lots of spices. It's spicy (both in terms of heat and amount of spices added to the dish), and the juices from the meats and chicken broth make the pasta wonderfully creamy.

An unspoken theme of this recipe book of a website is chicken: over 90% of my main dish recipes involve chicken. It's just so good. I'm quite aware of this, and I hope this recipe is refreshing for those of you with a more diverse meat repertoire.

#### Where's this recipe from?

This one-pot spicy dish is taken from [Emily Bites](https://emilybites.com/2020/01/one-pot-cajun-chicken-and-sausage-pasta.html "Emily Bites"). Per the site tagline, she specializes in lightened-up comfort food.

#### Anything to know before making it?

The first time I made this, I did not have diced tomatoes on hand and it still turned out well. 12 oz of pasta was a little too much: using a little less pasta, or adding more chicken broth, worked better on following trials. I also needed 15-20 minutes on medium-high heat to boil the pasta, but I used rigatoni the first time and the thickness of the noodles may have been a factor.

If you're eating gluten-free and dairy-free like I am, then sub in gluten-free pasta and take out the cream cheese.
