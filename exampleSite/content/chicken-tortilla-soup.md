Perfect for a cold day when you need something to warm your stomach. It's spicy, rich, and red, and looks great in a bowl with some tortilla chips, cilantro, and avocado. A staple winter recipe in this household.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[Food.com](https://www.food.com/recipe/amazing-chicken-tortilla-soup-108231 "Food.com")! More specifically, the author of this recipe is [Valerie Marie](https://www.food.com/user/180567?filter=recipes "Valerie"), who posted it back in 2005.

#### Anything to know before making it?

You can replace the jalape√±o with 1/2 tsp chili powder and a whole green pepper if you like.

If you're cooking for one, make 50 to 75 percent of the original recipe, because you don't want to eat soup for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, unless you're a leftovers connoisseur like me.
