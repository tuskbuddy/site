This meal's deliciousness-to-time ratio is sky-high. One of the things that makes Indian food good is caramelization, and this recipe starts with it right off the bat with onions and chicken with wonderful, fragrant spices. From there, it's about simmering and adding liquid until the chicken is tender and the aroma of garam masala and curry powder is wafting through your coconut curry kitchen.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[The Pretty Bee](https://theprettybee.com/easy-dairy-free-chicken-coconut-curry/ "The Pretty Bee") gets the well-deserved credit for this one! The author of this particular recipe notes that chicken coconut curry over Jasmine rice is her family's all-time favorite meal, which should highlight the excellence of this particular dish.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Caramelize the onion on medium-high heat. 15 ounces of coconut milk makes plenty of liquid, and you could get away with adding 1/2 lb more chicken and some diced bell peppers. Some liquid is necessary for the chicken to simmer, however, and if you like pouring the extra sauce over rice, then the recipe is great as is.

There are no spicy ingredients used in the official recipe, but I highly recommend either inserting cayenne pepper in the spice mix or adding red pepper flakes after the chicken is finished simmering.
