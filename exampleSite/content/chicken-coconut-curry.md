This meal's deliciousness-to-time ratio is sky-high. One of the things that makes Indian food good is caramelization, and this recipe starts with it right off the bat with onions and chicken with wonderful, fragrant spices. From there, it's about simmering and adding liquid until you smell the garam masala and curry powder wafting through your kitchen.

#### Where's this recipe from?

[The Pretty Bee](https://theprettybee.com/easy-dairy-free-chicken-coconut-curry/ "The Pretty Bee")! The author of this particular recipe notes that coconut curry over Jasmine rice is her family's all-time favorite meal. This is one of mine as well.

#### Anything to know before making it?

Caramelize the onion on medium-high heat. 15 ounces of coconut milk makes plenty of liquid, and you could get away with adding 1/2 lb more chicken and some diced bell peppers. Some liquid is necessary for the chicken to simmer, however, and if you like pouring the extra sauce over rice, then the recipe is great as is.

There are no spicy ingredients used in the official recipe, but I highly recommend either inserting cayenne pepper in the spice mix or adding red pepper flakes after the chicken is finished simmering.
