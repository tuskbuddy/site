# Personal Recipe Book

This site is a compilation of all of my favorite recipes! And perhaps some of yours. The link to the live site is <a href="https://tuskbuddy.netlify.app">tuskbuddy.netlify.app</a>. If the page appears misaligned on your first visit, refreshing the page should solve the issue.


This repo is built with Hugo, edited by Forestry, and deployed in Netlify. The theme is a modified version of <a href="https://www.github.com/themefisher/parsa-hugo">Parsa for Hugo</a>.
